# Authentication and Roles

Arctic uses the underlying Django authentication backend, but it adds its own
role base permission system. It also includes a user management app.

## Arctic `users` app

This app has a UI to manage users in arctic.

In `urls.py` add the following to `urlpatterns`:

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^users/', include('arctic.users.urls', namespace='users')),
]

And in `settings.py` add a reference to `ARCTIC_MENU`:

    ARCTIC_MENU = (
        ...
        ('Users', 'users:list', 'fa-user'),
    )
